# Direct Connect
Dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.
- Reduces costs when using large volumes of traffic. 
- Increased reliability. 
- Increased bandwidth. 
## VPN vs Direct Connect
- VPN configured in minutes, and a good solution for an immediate need that has low to moderate bandwidth requirements and can tolerate issues of internet based connectivity. 
- AWS Direct Connect does not involve the internet, use as a dedicated private network connection between intranet and VPC.
