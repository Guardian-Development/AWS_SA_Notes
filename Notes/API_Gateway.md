#Â API Gateway
Allows developers to publish, monitor, maintain and secure API's at scale. Acts a front door for applications to access data/backend services such as EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, or any web application. 
## API Caching
- Can enable to cache your endpoints response. This reduces the number of calls to your endpoint and improves latency. 
- Cache calls for a sepcified time-to-live period, in seconds.
## Benefits 
- Low cost and efficient. 
- Scales effortlessly. 
- Can throttle requests to prevent attacks. 
- Connect to CloudWatch to log all requests. 
## Same Origin Point
- A web browser permits scripts contained in first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if they have the same origin. 
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a way for the server to relax the same origin policy. 
- This allows requests from one domain to another, in order to access shared resources. You can enable this in API Gateway.
