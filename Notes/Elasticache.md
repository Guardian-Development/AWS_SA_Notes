# Elasticache 
A service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. Improves perfomance by allowing the retrieval of information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of having to read from disk. 
## Types of Elasticache 
- Memcached: memory object caching system. Elasticache conforms with Memcached protocol allowing seemless integration.
- Redis: open source, in-memory key-value store. Elasticache supports master-slave replication and Multi-AZ which can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy. 
## Features 
- Improves latency and throughput for many read heavy application workloads or compute intensive workloads. 
- Used when a particular database is under a lot of stress/load, and this can alleviate this. 
- Is a good choice if the database is particularily read heavy and not prone to frequent change.
