# Well Architected Framework
This is a set of questions that you can use to evaluate how well you architecture is aligned to AWS best practices. 
## General Design Principles
- Stop geussing capacity needs.
- Test systems at production scale. 
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier. 
- Allow for evolutionary architectures.
- Data driven architectures.
- Improve through game days (simulate large load to make sure the system doesn't fall over).
