# Cost Optimisation
Reduce your costs to a minimum. Enables you to pay the lowest price possible while still achieving your business objectives. 
## Design Principles 
- Transparently attribute expenditure. 
- Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership. 
- Trade capital expenditure for operating expenditure. 
- Benenfit from economics at scale. 
- Stop spending money on data center operations. 
## Matched Security and Demand
- Optimaly match supply with demand. As demand grows so should your supply of compute resources (Autoscaling).
- Lambda only responds (activates) when a request comes in. 
- CloudWatch can help you track of demand levels. 
## Cost Effective Resources
- Using correct instance tpe can be key to cost saving. Use larger instance type that executes in seconds rather than a small instance that runs for hours. 
- Use most cost effective resources to reach the end business goal. 
## Expenditure Awareness 
- No longer have to buy servers. However, each team can have their own AWS account within an organisation. Be aware of what each team is spending and where. 
- You can use cost allocation tags to track this, billing access as well as billing consolidation. 
## Optimising Over Time
- You should keep track of the changes made to AWS and constantly re-evaluate your existing architecture. 
- You can do this by subscribing to AWS blog and by using services such as Trusted Advisor.
